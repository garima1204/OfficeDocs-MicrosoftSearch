# Index quota
Any valid Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365, or Office 365 license allows you to view data from connectors in your Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Search results.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All connectors by Microsoft are free.

## What represents items in an index quota?
An item represents one unit of index quota. Each entity (or record) from the source system that is added to Microsoft Graph is considered an item. In Microsoft Graph, each item appears as a unique citation in Microsoft 365 Copilot responses and as a distinct search result in Microsoft Search. 

Depending on the type of data source, an item is defined as– 
-	1 document (Word, Excel, PPT, PDF, etc.) in a file share
-	1 wiki page in Confluence
-	1 webpage on a website
-	1 ticket or issue in Jira

The total quota utilized is based on the number of items stored in the index. The frequency of updates or changes to an item doesn't affect the quota calculation.

### Index quota for Microsoft 365 enterprise users

> [!NOTE]
> US Government Community Cloud (GCC) tenants are subject to the old quota rules. G1 and G3 don't qualify for any quota, but G5 does. G1 and G3 customers can purchase the Copilot connector add-on.

All eligible Microsoft 365 enterprise customers with one of the following licenses are entitled to an index quota that contributes to your organization’s allocation for ingesting content through Copilot connectors.

|License name|
|:---|
|Microsoft 365 Business Basic|
|Microsoft 365 Business Premium|
|Microsoft 365 Business Standard|
|Microsoft 365 A3|
|Microsoft 365 A5|
|Microsoft 365 E3|

|Office 365 A5|
|Office 365 E1|
|Office 365 E3|

> [!NOTE]
>Preview connectors don't count against the quota. Once a connector transitions to general availability, it starts counting toward the total index quota.
